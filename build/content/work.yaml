  when: in-progress
  shortDescription: A grammar-based text editor for touchscreen devices.
  description: |
    Writing code on a small touchscreen is frustrating. All text must be
    precisely input, which becomes cumbersome with a thumb keyboard; yet, at the
    same time, bits of text, in the form of keywords and identifiers, are often
    repeated throughout a source code document.
    
    _KeyTree_ attempts to solve this problem by offering a text input method which
    more closely mirrors a syntax tree of the source code. Such a syntax tree
    knows what kinds of text are valid at any point in a document. Relying on
    this knowledge allows rapid creation of source code on touchscreen devices,
    free of syntax errors.

- title: Janus
  when: spring 2014
  shortDescription: An expressive controller for slow electronic music.
  description: |
    _Janus_ is a new instrument which I designed and built as part of
    Butch Rovan's course entitled _Designing and Playing Alternate Controllers_.
    The instrument utilizes eight force-sensitive resistors to detect pressure at
    the fingertips, each of which controls the volume and timbre of a single
    voice; a rotary encoder connecting the two halves of the instrument, which
    the player uses to navigate through a vector of note groups; multi-colored
    lights, which provide visual feedback for the current note group; and an
    accelerometer for global timbre control. A Teensy converts the signals from
    these components into MIDI values, to be used in any MIDI-compliant
    application. (In the demonstration video above, I am controlling a Max patch
    which I built specifically for Janus's playstyle.)
    
    _Janus_ is designed to facilitate patterns of tension and release. _Janus_
    forces the performer to mirror sonic tension with gestural, physical
    tension. As the performer twists or grips Janus, the performer's body
    becomes contorted, and the music gains harmonic or spectral tension. Untying
    the performer's posture into a physical rest state releases that tension.

  when: fall 2014 - spring 2015
  shortDescription: A system for understanding interaction.
  description: |
    Inspired by Seymour Papert's writings on the Logo programming language, and
    by more recent functional reactive languages such as Elm and Max, _Plyn_
    is an IDE and graphical dataflow programming language for creating
    interactive "microworlds" - sites of exploration, structured by the user.
    
    Although _Plyn_ offers low-level scripting via JavaScript, the environment is
    designed around composing predefined "components" to create new functionality.
    By offering a live-coding environment, as well as many tools to inspect
    behavior throughout a program, _Plyn_ eschews the need to ingest and regurgitate
    an API: instead, _Plyn_ encourages the user to create by experimentation and by
    "feeling his way" around the system.

  shortDescription: Designs for a media manager towards a more personal web.
  description: |
    In the RISD graphic design course entitled _Computer Utopias,_ taught by the
    inimitable Chris Novello, I was tasked with designing a new software
    inspired by the Smalltalk programming language. Although I initially worked
    on a tool to compose functionality inspired by Smalltalk's ease of access
    and sense of empowerment, I changed course when I came to the realization
    that most non-programmers do not think in _function_, but in _media_.
    
    I designed _Pathfinder_ as a "Smalltalk for internet media" - an application
    which leverages specific routes through or networks among media to author
    function or meaning. (Along this path, I drew inspiration from Vannevar
    Bush's Memex. Although the Memex may seem to fit this description neatly, I
    would argue that its products - "trails" which serve as personalized linear
    references - are meaningless when applied to the breadth of internet media.)
    
    _Pathfinder_ is currently a design fiction.

  description: |
    _thsj_ is a tiny "game" based around grappling through space with friends.
    This simple yet deep mechanic allows for a variety of emergent playstyles,
    including racing, exploration, "skiing," and jousting. My goal with _thsj_
    was to create a sandbox in which people could interact with each other in a
    new way: the simplicity of the gameplay constrains and empowers the players.

  shortDescription: A digital audio workstation for composing textural remixes.
  description: |
    _multigran_ is a simple digital audio workstation for composing textural
    remixes. At the core of _multigran_ is a custom-made granular synthesis
    engine, which can be used to "grab" a sonic texture from an existing audio
    file. _multigran_ takes multiple instances of this engine and provides a
    graphic interface to manipulate each instance, allowing the user to build
    complex sonic textures.
