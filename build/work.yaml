    But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure
    and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the
    system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth,
    the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids
    pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know
    how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely
    painful.
